# vc-BrightenDarkRoles
A Vencord plugin that sets hardly visible roles on usernames to white for readability. Based on the ircColors plugin.

This branch is made to be a replacement for roleColorEverywhere, as it applies its role colors along with the luminance increase, and will interfere with the original plugin.
